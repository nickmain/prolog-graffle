Prolog theories for parsing the important structure (not the graphic appearance) from Omnigraffle diagrams.

Applications include:

* the implementation of hierarchical state machines in Prolog, based on statechart diagrams.
* visual grammars (such as rail-road diagrams) for generating parsers
* authoring OWL ontologies as Omnigraffle diagrams
